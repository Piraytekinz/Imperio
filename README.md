# Imperio
Imperio (formally Dental AI) is a dental image analysis software built to analyze dental images and predict their most likely illness.

I built and trained the prediction model using tensorflow, and saved it as a .h5 file. The model is loaded through javascript, which collects the uploaded image data and runs a prediction.
